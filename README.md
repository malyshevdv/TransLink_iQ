This solution includes the implementation of the library connection with all API-functions and the implementation of business logic: Authorize sales, Authorize void and Authorize partial void, close day operatio, print totals.

I constantly have to work with cash and acquiring equipment, because the acceptance and accounting of money in trade is very important. Usually, to connect new equipment, a specific DLL library is used that is tied to this specific equipment model. When installing a new equipment model, you need to look for an updated library or change the accounting program.
 
ASHBURN International has implemented a universal approach to managing cash register equipment. ASHBURN International employees take on the setup of interaction with new equipment models. For integrators, two options for interacting with equipment are offered: ActiveX-connect and RestX-connect, which have a universal set of commands for external equipment.

Our universal solution, developed by ONESOFT, allows you to connect acquiring equipment that works through ASHBURN International TransLink.iQ software to your ERP, cash, and warehouse program. With our solution, we can make integration in a short time both with the accounting system of our production and with third-party programs.
We use the RestX-connect method for integration since it has no restrictions on the type of operating system used. 
Our solution is localized for English and Georgian. After integration, your system administrator can independently configure the new device in user mode as shown below.
