Our universal solution, developed by ONESOFT, allows you to connect acquiring equipment that works through
ASHBURN International TransLink.iQ software to your ERP, cash and warehouse program. With our solution,
we can make integration in a short time both with the accounting system of our production and with third-party programs.

We use the RestX-connect method for integration, since it has no restrictions on the type of operating system used.
Our solution is localized for English and Georgian. After integration, your system administrator can independently
configure the new device in user mode
